# Nonlinear Material Parameter Identification of Soft Materials based on an Inverse Finite Element Method Approach

Laparoscopic surgery and robot-assisted surgery are gaining popularity in recent years, due to its less invasive factor. Therefore, the educational training for this kind of surgery is of outmost importance. Simulators based on mechanical models have been developed for this task, nevertheless, there is certain difficulty to determine the material properties of organs with different cancer stages.

Meanwhile, another difficulty is the measurement of the physical properties of the organs under certain limitations, like the time in which the measurements can be done, and the restriction to be able to modify the organ after extraction. Therefore, the measurement of these properties is done through an indentation experiment. Through punctual compressions it is possible to determine material behavior and observe its deformation and force reactions.

A goal for this study is to use inverse finite element analysis for the identification of the material parameters needed for the material modeling. This will be performed using the acquired data from the loading experiments and parting from certain assumptions for the material model.  

The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate if this process can lead to a validated material model, which describes a nonlinear material behavior based on essential material parameters and what the limitations and impact of these are.
