	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

   abstract = {Polymer gels are widely accepted as candidate materials for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and orthopedic load-bearing applications. In addition, their mechanical and physical properties can be tailored to meet a wide range of design requirements. For soft gels whose elastic modulus is in the kPa range, mechanical characterization by bulk mechanical testing methods presents challenges, for example, in sample preparation, fixture design, gripping, and/or load measurement accuracy. Nanoindentation, however, has advantages when characterizing the mechanical properties of soft materials. This study was aimed at investigating the application of an inverse finite element analysis technique to identify material parameters of polymer gels via nanoindentation creep testing, optimization, and finite element simulation. Nanoindentation experiments were conducted using a rigid circular flat punch, and then simulated using the commercial software ABAQUS™. The optimization (error minimization) procedure was integrated in the parameter determination process using a Matlab™ shell program, which makes this approach readily adaptable to other test geometries and material models. The finite element results compare well with a derived analytical viscoelastic solution for a rigid circular flat punch on a Kelvin-Voigt half-space. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This paper contains the description of an experimental and a computational study of small punch test using circular disk shaped miniature specimen, through inverse finite element procedure. An inverse finite element procedure is developed and clubbed with ABAQUS computer code for the determination of constitutive tensile behavior of materials. The proposed inverse technique is based on the small punch experimental load vs. displacement curve. Small punch tests (SPT) are conducted on circular disk shaped specimen (10 mm diameter, 0.5 mm thick) made from three different steels. By using the output of experimental small punch test, constitutive stress-strain curves are traced through inverse technique. The computed constitutive stress-strain curves are compared with the curves obtained from a standard conventional tensile test and the results obtained for all the three cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the present inverse procedure. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The fibrous cap of an atherosclerotic plaque may be prone to rupture if the occurring stresses exceed the strength of the cap. Rupture can cause acute thrombosis and subsequent ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. A reliable prediction of the rupture probability is essential for the appropriate treatment of atherosclerosis. Biomechanical models, which compute stresses and strain, are promising to provide a more reliable rupture risk prediction. However, these models require knowledge of the local biomechanical properties of atherosclerotic plaque tissue. For this purpose, we examined human carotid plaques using indentation experiments. The test set-up was mounted on an inverted confocal microscope to visualise the collagen fibre structure during the tests. By using an inverse finite element (FE) approach, and assuming isotropic neo-Hookean behaviour, the corresponding Young's moduli were found in the range from 6 to 891. kPa (median 30. kPa). The results correspond to the values obtained by other research groups who analysed the compressive Young's modulus of atherosclerotic plaques. Collagen rich locations showed to be stiffer than collagen poor locations. No significant differences were found between the Young's moduli of structured and unstructured collagen architectures as specified from confocal collagen data. Insignificant differences between the middle of the fibrous cap, the shoulder regions, and remaining plaque tissue locations indicate that axial, compressive mechanical properties of atherosclerotic plaques are independent of location within the plaque. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
