\section{Inverse Finite Element Method for parameter estimation}

An inverse finite element approach requires usually a certain experimental model,
 which generates certain information e. g. load-displacement curve, and through 
a verified computational model match the given data curve to obtain further information 
of the material's behavior e. g., stress-strain curve.

Specially for nonlinear cases (husain2004), where the complexity of the problems 
increases, and the interest is focused to generate an action which results in a 
certain output response, is where an inverse finite element approach can be helpful 
to discover a certain variable going from an ouput data. Through an iterative process it is 
possible to describe the material's behavior and validate the output data it 
through other established testing e. g., uniaxial testing.

Though this approach does not always give a hundred percent match in all obtain points 
or zones, it allows the researcher to understand the influences of certain parameters 
for the materials. This is specially useful for complex materials as biomaterials. 

Biomaterials, as mentioned previously, depends on multiple external factors, e.g., blood 
pressure, affected diseases and the their material properties is constantly changing. 
This issue does not allow the researcher to develop a proper material model which is 
usable for multiple use-cases. 

Therefore, the importance of the inverse element method as relevant key for estimating 
constantly changing parameters in soft materials.

\section{Material Experiment testing in Organs}

Indentation have being gaining popularity in the last decades and it is now one of
 the most spread experiments for material parameter identification.

As some materials do not allow the use of uniaxial or biaxial tensile testing, the
 use of identation testing is essential for this case.
