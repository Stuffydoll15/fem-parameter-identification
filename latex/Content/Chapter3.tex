\section{Experimental model}

\subsection{First Experimental model}
The chosen experimental technique for the inverse identification for this project was indentation. 
The test specimen used for this experiment was a ultra-soft polyurethane resin. 
In Fig.. the specimen possesses a ellipsoidal form with 
with a minor radius \(r_1\) of 35 mm and a major radius \(r_2\) of 60 mm. This is positioned
 on a fixed platform that suits the ellipsoidal geometry of the 
 specimen. A pin with a rounded head made of structural steel, has a radius of \(r_3\) 3 mm is attached 
 by the holding grips followed by a force load cell. 
 The measured force data showed a very small number, so the 
 first 50 N load cell displayed a lot of noise in the measured data. 
 Therefore, the load cell was change to 10N to reduce this interference. 
The 10 N load cell displayed the initial contact between the indenter and the specimen
 in a finer way. In order to get the measurement of the load and unloading process of
 the indentation a displacement sensor was attached to the tensile machine.

 The indentation depth \(h_1\) selected for the first model was 3,8 mm on the middle of the 
 top surface of the specimen. This indentation depth surpasses the pin radius \(r_3\) and 
 was chose arbitriarily to analyze the behavior of the material on the defined position.

 Additionally, it was observed that in soft materials it is easier to capture 
 some parameters with a larger indentation. Some references also observe that with
 indentation depth lower than indenter radius has a lot of noise and do not describe
 th results accurately %reference?

 From the first experimental model we can observe that the material shows a nonlinear 
 behavior and the maximum total force reaction \(F_1\) lies around 0.45 N. %poner el grafico
 Furthermore, when applying different speeds, as show in Fig. %add figure 
 it is also possible to observe that 
 the hysteresis increases. %poner los speeds
This increasement shows that the material possesses a viscoelastic behavior, however
as this increasement is not significantly, it is possible to neglect viscoelasticity for 
the first stages of the project.

\subsection{Second Experimental model}
The second experimental model was developed by Yokohama National University. Similar to 
the first experimental model the test specimen and the platform were it lies, has the 
same dimensions, minor radius \(r_1\) of 35 mm and a major radius \(r_2\) of 60 mm. The
test specimen is also made from the same material, ultra-soft polyurethane resin.

The indenter on the other hand, is a sphere made of ruby, the sphere radius is also 
equal to the radius of the pin \(r_s\) 3 mm and attached to it, is the force load cell.

A laser is used to measure the displacement which results in a load-displacement curve.
With this model it is possible to not only determine the toal force reaction, but also
it's components \(F_x\),  \(F_y\) and \(F_z\). Furthermore, with the laser it is also
possible to observe the deformation not only in one point but around the whole area. 
This allows as to analyze the deformation of the whole structure.

and with an indentation depth of \(h_s\) is 4 mm. With this experiment, 4 key points on 
the sepcimen's surface were chosen: First, in the middle and three other points, one to right, 
one down, and one diagonal to middle, forming a square with a distance between points 
of \(d_s\) 20 mm. %add figure with points

\section{Material model framework assumptions}

The first point to be analyzed, which is used to build a material model is point No. 1,
in the middle of the surface. The advantages from this case, is the less influence of
external factors. For this case it is vaiable to assumed, that shear stresses can be 
neglected and offers a simple model to focus on the material definition.

For this project, there is a focus on the limitation of each material model, 
departing from an ideal scenario. From this point on the material will be build 
accordingly and for each model the influence of the material parameters is going
to be assessed.

\section{Computational model}
The quasi static nature of the indentation experiment allows the use of a static 
structural analysis.

Their a two main factors which increases the complexity of the validation of the simulation
and those are, the contact nonlinearity, and the element distortion due to indentation
 experiment. These issues make the computational time expensive, as it requires to manual 
 solutions for the meshing in the area of importance, and small time steps.

A force-displacement curve, shown in Fig... is generated from the first assumption, 
for this case 
%Additionally due to these factors, the converge analysis

\section{Material model}

In an ideal and first scenario, this material can be assumed as linear, isotropic, 
elastic and nearly imcompressible. For this case, there are two main variables, the Young's
Modulus \(E\), and the Poisson's ratio $\nu$.
