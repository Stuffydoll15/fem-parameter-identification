\section{Overview and Analysis}
Upon applying the RSO and MATLAB optimization to identify the optimal material parameter set, 
multiple sets were calculated. 
Each simulation deployed various Neo-Hookean parameters sets and 
had a unique load-displacement solutions. These load-displacement curves were 
juxtaposed with the experimental data and the RMSE and NRMSE (Equation \ref{eq:rmse} and \ref{eq:nrmse}) was calculated to quantify the quality 
of each solution. To deepen the evaluation, additional performance metrics were incorporated: 
Mean Relative Error (MRE) (Equation \ref{eq:mre}), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
\begin{align}
    \text{MAPE} = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right| \,,
\end{align}
and  Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE)  
\begin{align}
    \text{RRMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right)^2} \,.
\end{align}
%https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/evaluation-metric-for-regression-models/   
Performance metrics are critical for evaluating the predictive accuracy of the computational model.
These metrics provide insights into how well the model's prediction align with the 
experimental data. The combination of these metrics allowed for a more comprehensive 
assessment of all the simulations performance. For instance, the RMSE and NRMSE measured the
absolute deviation of the predicted values from the observed data, providing an overall 
measure of the computational model accuracy. On the other hand, metrics like MRE, MAPE. and 
RRMSE are useful when considering relative errors. These metrics weighed errors in relation
to the actual size of the actual values \cite{Rajagukguk2020}.\\

The simulation results that produced the lowest performance metrics were set aside as possible
optimal candidates. In particular, the parameters with the lowest NRMSE, MRE and RMSRE were  
investigated. Moreover, a set with an elevated incompressibility parameter was chosen for 
analyzing its influence on validation cases.
The parameters that were determined to provide the best fit to the 
experimental data based on these assessments were listed on Table \ref{tab:materialsetbestfit}.

\subsection*{Assessment of Performance Metrics}
Defining good performance metrics values required a multi-dimensional approach. 
Firstly, the load-displacement curves' visual inspection revealed a close approximation 
to the experimental data (Fig. \ref{fig:bestfitcandidatescurve}).

The load-displacements curves illustrated that the initial slope of EM II was steeper compared to 
all calculated candidate sets. As the displacement increased sets \SI{1}{} through \SI{3}{} intersected 
the experimental curve. Set \SI{1}{} and \SI{2}{} were nearly identical, initially exhibited an increasing 
slope, yet displayed a tendency to flatten towards the end of the curve, intersecting the experimental curve 
a second time.

On the other hand, set \SI{3}{} crossed the experimental curve around $u=\SI{1.5}{\milli \meter}$, showcasing 
a steeper slope relative to the experimental curve. 

Set \SI{4}{} displayed a pronounced curvature at the outset, followed by an increase in steepness of its slope.
However, it remained constantly below throughout the experimental data.\\

   \label{fig:bestfitcandidatescurve}%
\end{figure}

In addition to the visual analysis, the mean of the performance metrics for all models were calculated and 
compared to its lowest value. Similarly, a baseline model of each performance metric was calculated and 
also compared to the candidate sets (Table \ref{tab:performancegoodness}). 

To clarify, the lowest value of the NRMSE was $\SI{0.0339}{}$. The mean NRMSE across all models was 
$\SI{0.1662}{}$, suggesting that models with an NRMSE below this value outperformed the average.
Consequently, the baseline NRMSE, represented a simple model predicting the mean load-displacement, was 
$\SI{0.6835}{}$, indicating that models with an NRMSE below this value surpassed the baseline model.\\

\end{table}

Given the proximity of the values among all candidates, except for set \SI{4}{}, it was 
initially inferred that utilizing NRMSE as the sole performance metric would be adequate for 
evaluating the goodness of fit in this specific case, an indentation of $h=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$
at the center of the surface.

\section{Validation of Computational Model}
\label{section:validationcm}
In order to confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the identified material parameters,
two distinct validation cases were performed. 
The first validation case (VC I) involved the alteration of the indentation depth, changing it to 
$\SI{8}{\milli \meter}$ from the original $\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$. This case aimed to assess how 
well the material model could adapt and represent the mechanical behavior with increased deformation.

The second validation case (VC II)  revolved around the deformation profile of the spe-\\cimen. The aim here 
was understand the accuracy in predicting the actual deformation shape of the specimen under 
indentation. This provided deeper insights into the effects of the selected incompressibility
parameters.\\

The experimental models for the validation cases followed the same procedural guidelines 
described in Chapter \ref{chapter:experimentalmodel} for experimental model II. 
Furthermore, for the validation cases only Sets \SI{1}{}, \SI{3}{} and \SI{4}{} were evaluated (Table \ref{tab:materialsetbestfit}).
As set \SI{2}{} demonstrated nearly identical results as set \SI{1}{}, it was not considered for the 
validation process.

\subsection{Deeper Indentation}
\label{subsection:8mm}
The first validation experiment featured an indentation depth of $h_{VC1}=\SI{8}{\milli \meter}$,
doubling the previous indentation depth of $h=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$ at the center of the specimen's 
surface or middle point. Computational model II, described in Chapter \ref{chapter:computationalmodel},
was used with the adjusted indentation depth (Fig. \ref{fig:stressdis8mm}).\\

To facilitate the comparison of the remaining candidates, the load-displacement curves for the 
set \SI{1}{} with the lowest NRMSE, set \SI{3}{} with the lowest RRMSE, and set \SI{4}{}  with the highest 
incompressibility parameter, were plotted against the experimental data, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:8mmloaddisplcurves}.\\

   \label{fig:8mmloaddisplcurves}%
\end{figure}

The load-displacement graph showed that the experimental data displayed again a steeper initial slope 
than the computational models. Sets \SI{1}{} and \SI{3}{} curves intersected the experimental curve 
around a displacement of $u=\SI{2}{\milli \meter}$, whereas set \SI{4}{} intersected at about $u=\SI{3}{\milli \meter}$.

As displacement increased to $u=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$, the curves for sets \SI{1}{} and \SI{3}{} began 
to flatten and fell beneath the experimental curve, while set \SI{4}{} maintained its steepness and remained above.
At a displacement of $u=\SI{8}{\milli \meter}$, set \SI{4}{} with a maximum force of 
$F_{4_{max}}=\SI{1.3951}{\newton}$ managed to produce the closest 
approximation to the maximum experimental force $F_{II_{max}}=\SI{1.283}{\newton}$.

The new NRMSE values were significantly higher than those of the first case (Table \ref{tab:nrmse8mm}). 
Noteworthy, set \SI{3}{}, with a lower NRMSE for the first case, and set \SI{4}{} with a higher $D_1$ 
exhibited a better NRMSE performance for this case, in contrast to set \SI{1}{}, which had shown 
the best performance for the $h=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$ indentation.\\

    \hline
    Set & $\mu$ (Pa) & $D_1$ (MPa\textsuperscript{-1}) & EM II NRMSE & VC I NRMSE\\

    \caption[NRMSE for first validation case]{Comparison of the NRMSE calculated for the EM II and for the first validation case with a deeper indentation.}

\end{table}

This suggested that the identified parameters may not be able to capture the behavior 
of the material at larger indentations. Therefore, a case-specific parameter identification
for accurate modelling of larger indentations would be required.\\

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Deformation Profile Analysis}
\label{subsection:defprofanalysis}
The second validation case evaluated the deformation profile of the specimen for the first 
indentation case of $h=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$ in the middle of the specimen's surface. The goal 
was to understand how the selection of the incompressibility parameter, linked to the 
bulk modulus, influenced the deformation shape under indentation.\\

To capture the deformation shape of the specimen, the displacement of the points along an axis positioned 
$\SI{5}{\milli \meter}$ parallel to the X-axis were calculated (Fig. \ref{fig:defprofdiagram}). %Figure of diagram of
This reference line was chosen to avoid any optical interference caused by the indenter during the 
laser measurements, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:defprofinter}.
Figure \ref{fig:defprofexperiment} illustrates the experiment conducted by YNU.
Using the marked points as reference, the laser displacement meter captured the specimen's 
shape along the parallel axis both before and during the indentation process.
This allowed for the measurement of the deformation profile at intervals of $\SI{1}{\milli \meter}$
throughout the indentation until reaching the maximum depth of $\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$ was reached (Appendix \ref{AppendixA}).\\

\end{figure}

From the results calculated with the computational model II for the middle point case, 
a method to capture the deformation profile for the second validation case was required.
However, tracking specific points on the surface of the simulation was challenging due to 
the remeshing process of the nonlinear adaptive meshing option utilized in the model. This
process did not support the measurement of the displacement for a specific node, as the 
position of the node changed throughout the execution of the model's calculation.\\

To overcome this issue, a section plane was created, located $\SI{5}{\milli \meter}$ to the 
right of the symmetry axis, similar to the experimental model. Probe points were then
selected around the deformed surface within this plane (Fig. \ref{fig:defprofcompmodel}).

   \label{fig:defprofcompmodel}%
\end{figure}

The deformation profiles for the remaining candidate sets were compared with the experimental
data, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:defprofiledata}. Although all computational models 
showed some degree of misalignment with the experimental data, the position of maximum deformation,
Point \SI{5}{} next to middle point, had a close match for sets \SI{1}{} and \SI{3}{}.

Further, as the incompressibility parameter decreased, the overall deformation decreased. The 
NRMSE values for this case were listed on Table \ref{tab:nrmsedefprof}. The NRMSE results 
revealed that the set \SI{3}{} had the best value followed closely by set \SI{1}{}. This validation case 
showcased that the selection of the range set for the iFEM process impacts the deformation response, even though the
influence of the incompressibility parameter on the force reaction results was relatively minor.\\

Based on the combined results of both validation cases and their NRMSE values, set 3 with a 
shear modulus $\mu=\SI{10200}{\pascal}$ and the incompressibility parameter $D_1=\SI{1.1}{\mega\pascal\tothe{-1}}$ 
was identified as the best overall choice. This material parameter set captured with good 
agreement the indentation for EM II, and showed the best results for the deformation profile 
validation case and the deeper indentation case.  

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Nearby Point - Blue Point}
\label{subsection:bluepoint}
After identifying set \SI{3}{} as the best candidate from the initial two validation cases, this 
parameter set was subjected to a third validation test. This experiment was conducted on a 
nearby point, referred to as the blue point (BP), situated at a diagonal distance of approximately $\SI{3.5}{\milli \meter}$ 
from the middle point, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:bluepointdiag}.\\%insert diag

   \label{fig:bluepointdiag}%
\end{figure}
To mimic the conditions of the experimental model II, the indentation depth was kept at $h_{VCIII}=\SI{4}{\milli \meter}$.
Based on the insights acquired from the deeper indentation validation case, it was considered 
prudent to maintain this depth to ensure that the selected material parameters would accurately 
represent the behavior of the specimen for this new indentation point.\\

In this use case, unlike the previous ones, the full computational model was required, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bluepointcm}.
The symmetry boundary conditions used before were not applicable due to shifted indentation position.
With exception from these conditions the blue point model followed the process as computational model II, described 
in Section \ref{section:cmII}.

\end{figure}

Furthermore, it was anticipated based on previous nearby point experiments that force components in 
x and y directions would become significant the further the indentation position was from the middle point (Subsection \ref{subsection:nearbypointresult}).
Hence, these components were included in the analysis alongside the z-direction force component.\\

The load displacement curves comparison for the middle and blue point revealed distinct behaviors.
For the middle point in Figure \ref{fig:mpforcecompvc}, the x-force component in the computational model was close to zero,
in comparison to the experimental data, which possessed a small but noticeable peak. 
Moreover, the simulation results for this force component appeared unstable.

On the contrary, the y-force component showed show a clear nonlinear trend in the computational model,
whereas the experimental curve showed minimal variation. The z-force component was previously analyzed 
and used to identify the material parameters, therefore has the closest match between the curves.

The total force curve exhibited a similar initial slope difference as showcased for the z-force component
However, after reaching a displacement of $u\approx\SI{1.2}{\milli \m}$, the simulation curve showed a increased slope,
diverging slightly from the experimental data.\\

The calculated NRMSE for all components and the total force reaction of the middle point test were listed in Table \ref{tab:forcecompnrmse}.
In the table was observed that the components for x and y showed high NRMSE values, but 
the z-component and the total force still lied below or slightly higher than the 
acceptable NRMSE limit of $\SI{0.1668}{}$.\\

%blue point
The blue point case a greater alignment across for the x and y-components and the total force reaction, but
the NRMSE value for the z-component worsened from $\SI{0.0534}{}$ to $\SI{0.09}{}$ (Table \ref{tab:forcecompnrmse}).
In this validation case, the force components showed nonlinear trends in both the 
experimental and computational curves, with the simulation closely matching the
maximum forces obtained experimentally, with exception of the y-component, as 
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:bpforcecompvc}.
This indicated that the identified parameters in set \SI{3}{} was suitable 
for the blue case as well, in addition to display more stable results for 
all load-displacements curves.\\

In conclusion, the third validation case reinforced the validity of set number
\SI{3}{} as the chosen parameter set for this study. This set 
demonstrated an acceptable level of agreement for all cases with an equal 
indentation depth. Moreover, this validation supported that this material model 
can model the behavior of the polyurethane specimen under indentation, particularly
when considering different locations on the specimen's surface and all 
force components into the analysis.

\section{Limitations and Implications of the Results}



%\subsection{First Experimental model}
%The chosen experimental technique for the inverse identification for this project was indentation. 
%The test specimen used for this experiment was a ultra-soft polyurethane resin. 
%As shown in Fig.. the specimen possesses a ellipsoidal form with 
%with a minor radius \(r_1\) = 35 mm and a major radius \(r_2\) = 60 mm. This was positioned
% on a fixed platform that suited the ellipsoidal geometry of the 
% specimen to constrain its movement. 
% The specimen was tested in a indentation test configuration with a tensile/compression machine.
% To achieve this congiguration a pin with a rounded head made of structural steel, 
% with a radius of \(r_3\) = 3 mm was attached 
% to the holding grips followed by a force load cell. 
%The result of indentation test was a load-displacement points. The approximated 
%polynomial curve was used as a reference for the material modeling.

%test specimen is loaded at a quasi-static rate

% The measured force reation \(F_1\) data showed a very small number, so the 
% first 50 N load cell displayed a lot of noise in the measurements. 
% Therefore, the load cell was change to 10N to reduce this interference. 
%The 10 N load cell displayed the force-displacement curve of the indenter and the specimen
% in a finer way. Furthermore, in order to get the measurement of the load and 
% unloading process of
% the indentation a displacement sensor was attached to the tensile machine.

% The indentation depth \(h_1\) selected for the first model was 3,8 mm on the middle of the 
% top surface of the specimen. This indentation depth surpasses the pin radius \(r_3\) and 
% was chose arbitriarily to analyze the behavior of the material on the defined position.
 %reference?
 Additionally, it was observed that in soft materials it is easier to capture 
 some parameters with a larger indentation. Some references also observe that with
 indentation depth lower than indenter radius has a lot of noise and do not describe
 th results accurately. %reference?

%\subsection{Second Experimental model}
%The second experimental model was developed by Yokohama National University. Similar to 
%the first experimental model the test specimen and the platform were it lies, has the 
%same dimensions, minor radius $r_1 = \SI{35}{\milli \m}$ and a major radius \(r_2\) of 60 mm. The
%test specimen is also made from the same material, ultra-soft polyurethane resin.
%
%The indenter on the other hand, is a sphere made of ruby, the sphere radius is also 
%equal to the radius of the pin \(r_s\) 3 mm and attached to it, is the force load cell.
%
%A laser is used to measure the displacement which results in a load-displacement curve.
%With this model it is possible to not only determine the toal force reaction, but also
%it's components \(F_x\),  \(F_y\) and \(F_z\). Furthermore, with the laser it is also
%possible to observe the deformation not only in one point but around the whole area. 
%This allows as to analyze the deformation of the whole structure.
%
%The indentation speed selcted was % ask for which speeed
%and with an indentation depth of \(h_s\) is 4 mm. With this experiment, 4 key points on 
%the sepcimen's surface were chosen: First, in the middle and three other points, one to right, 
%one down, and one diagonal to middle, forming a square with a distance between points 
%of \(d_s\) 20 mm. %add figure with points

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\section{Material model framework assumptions}
%
%The first point to be analyzed, which is used to build a material model is point No. 1,
%in the middle of the surface. The advantages from this case, is the less influence of
%external factors. For this case it is vaiable to assumed, that shear stresses can be 
%neglected and offers a simple model to focus on the material definition.
%
%For this project, there is a focus on the limitation of each material model, 
%departing from an ideal scenario. From this point on the material will be build 
%accordingly and for each model the influence of the material parameters is going
%to be assessed.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Material model}

%n an ideal and first scenario, this material can be assumed as linear, isotropic, 
%lastic and nearly imcompressible. For this case, there are two main variables, the Young's
%odulus \(E\), and the Poisson's ratio $\nu$.

%comentario sobre la influencia del bulk modulus y poissons ratio
From the parametric analysis, it is possible to see that the bulk 
modulus of this material does not possess a big impact in the FE 
simulation results. This conclusion combined with the results 
from the Poisson ratio in the first material model coincide with the 
statements from Bergström, where it is no vital to know these parameters 
to obtain accurate FE computational models, as these have limited
influence on the mechanical response. \cite{Bergström2015} %pag64Bergströom
